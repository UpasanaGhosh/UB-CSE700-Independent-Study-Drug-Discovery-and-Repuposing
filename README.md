### Using Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN) on Tox21 dataset to find the feature molecule
*** What are GCNs? ***
Graph Convolutional Networks are a type of deep learning architectures that are specifically designed to work with life science data. GCN is a powerful neural network architecture for machine learning on molecular data as they can be naturally visualized as graphical structures. GCNs are so powerful that even a randomly initiated 2-layer GCN can produce useful feature representations of the nodes in the networks.
